### Brief Explanation <br>
This project is dedicated to organising notes in a systematic matter online. Have you ever needed to study for a test and forgotten where your paper notes are? Or just have stacks of pages of notes but also some digital ones? CleanNotes aims to synchronise this by allowing you to take blank notes directly online, but also allow you to scan notes from paper to turn into digital text notes. Features that I hope to integrate soon include making the "Upload PDF" come to life; in which users can upload content like lecturer slides and take notes on each slide independantly. <br><br>
